Description: Base R's once done choice of setting stringsAsFactors within
  `data.frame() and `as.data.frame()` to TRUE by default is a design decission
  that makes sense on the one hand and on the other hand is supposedly the most
  often complained about piece of code in the R insfrastructure. The hellno
  package provides a explcit solution wihtout changing R itself or having to
  mess around with options. It tries to solve this problem by providing
  alternative `data.frame()` and `as.data.frame()` functions that are in fact
  simple wrappers around base R's `data.frame()` and `as.data.frame()` with
  stringAsFactors option set to HELLNO ( == FALSE ) by default.
