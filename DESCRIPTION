    as.data.frame()

Description: Base R default setting for `stringsAsFactors=TRUE` within
    `data.frame() and `as.data.frame()` is supposedly the most often complained
    about piece of code in the R insfrastructure. The hellno package provides
    a explcit solution without changing R itself or having to mess around with
    options. It tries to solve this problem by providing alternative
    `data.frame()` and `as.data.frame()` functions that are in fact simple
    wrappers around base R's `data.frame()` and `as.data.frame()` with
    `stringAsFactors` option set to HELLNO ( which in turn equals FALSE )
    by default.
