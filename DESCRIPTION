Description: Base R's once done choice of setting stringsAsFactors within `data.frame() and  to TRUE by
  default is a design decission that makes sense on the one hand and is
  supposedly the most often complained about piece of code on the other. The
  hellno package tries to solve this problem by providing alternative `data.frame()`
  and `as.data.frame()` functions that are equivalent to base R's functions but
  in respect to the `stringsAsFactors` parameter.
