**Introduction**




Base R's `stringsAsFactors` default setting is supposedly the 
  most often complained about piece of code in the whole R infrastructure. 
  A search through the source code of all CRAN packages in December 2015 ([Link](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Acran+stringsAsFactors&type=Code))
  resulted in 3,492 mentions of `stringsAsFactors`. Most of the time these explicit 
  mentions where found within calls to `data.frame()` or `as.data.frame()` and 
  simply set the value to `FALSE`. 
  
  The hellno package provides an explicit solution to the problem without 
  changing R itself or having to mess around with options. One could use e.g.:
  `options("stringsAsFactors" = FALSE)` to re-set the global default behavior. 
  Instead hellno tackles the problem from another direction, namely by 
  providing alternative implementations of `data.frame()` and `as.data.frame()`. 
  Those *re*-implementations are in fact simple wrappers around base R's very own 
  `data.frame()` and `as.data.frame()` with `stringAsFactors` option set to 
  `HELLNO` - which in turn equals to `FALSE` and gives the package its name.

**Using hellno interactively**


Using the package is simple - load it, note the message indicating masking two base functions and code on - from now on no type conversion will take place within `data.frame()` and `as.data.frame()`:


```r
# options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cran.rstudio.com"))
# install.packages("hellno")
library(hellno)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'hellno'
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
## 
##     as.data.frame, data.frame
```


```r
df2 <- data.frame(a=letters[1:3])
class(df2$a)
```

```
## [1] "character"
```




**Using hellno for package development**


While using hellno in interactive R is nice, in fact its real strength is 
that it can be imported when writing packages. 
Once imported `stringsAsFactors=FALSE` will be the default for all uses of 
`data.frame()` and `as.data.frame()` within all package functions BUT NOT OUTSIDE OF IT. 

Thus it provides a way to ease programming while also ensuring that package users can
still choose which flavor of `stringsAsFactors` they like best. 


Let us see how this works following a little example. Again, let us start with loading hellno package:


```r
library(hellno)
data.frame(a=letters[1:2])$a 
```

```
## [1] "a" "b"
```

As shown before, character vectors are not transformed to factor when hellno is loaded.

We unload hellno again to start clean. 


```r
unloadNamespace("hellno")
```

Now we install the hellnotest package from GitHub and load it. The hellnotest package imports hellno and therefore its function `hellno_df()` will not convert character vectors to factor while functions outside the packages scope will not be affected: 



```r
if( !("hellnotests" %in% installed.packages()) ){
  devtools::install_github("petermeissner/hellnotests")
}

library(hellnotests)
```

While all functions within the package use hellno's alternative implementations:


```r
hellno_df
```

```
## function () 
## {
##     data.frame(a = letters[1:3])$a
## }
## <environment: namespace:hellnotests>
```

... and hence for them character vector conversion does not happen anymore:


```r
hellno_df()
```

```
## [1] "a" "b" "c"
```

... functions outside the package (like `data.frame()` from the base package) are not affected at all: 


```r
data.frame(a=letters[1:2])$a 
```

```
## [1] a b
## Levels: a b
```






**Summing it up**



- Using hellno interactively makes the change of the default setting very explicit. 
- Writing packages with hellno does not change outside behavior. 
- R is Rsome. 


Have fun.






**Discussion**


If you have thoughts/ideas on the "stringsAsFactors"-problem, e.g. you do not like this solution because ... I [herewith open the issues section](https://github.com/petermeissner/hellno/issues) of [the package's GitHub repository](https://github.com/petermeissner/hellno) for general discussion of the theme and related stuff. I am very much interested on what you think.
